			<h3>Modules</h3>
			<p>Since last update 3 more modules have been completed! Module 5 "Developing Websites Locally" was the easiest of these 3 as it introduced the concept of using specified Text Editors for web building - software I already had installed in two instances, one editor for video games and another for digital instrument design. In fact I had already become familiar with the latter in developing the earlier iterations of Growings On.
			<br><br>Before I start tooting my own horn too much Modules 6 and 7 were slightly more challenging. The steepest learning curve so far was found in "Deploying Websites", which although a tough challenge has allowed me to share this newsletter as a link, rather than as a technology challenge in and of itself! As a bonus puzzle I set myself the challenge of hosting vols 1 and 2 in an archive for posterity (links to both can be found at the bottom of the page <a href="#footer">here</a>. While I did have this system successfully working using Vol 2 as a test subject it was very messy. As I have found previously with problems of this nature they often solve themselves if you leave them alone for a while before coming back to them. My folders are now cleaner than my desk could ever hope of being. It's odd that my brain is much more accepting of the concept of tidy when it comes to file management.</p><p id="center">(apologies to Katy)</p>
			<p>In between scratching my head with neater web deployment strategies I completed another module on CSS topics covering new approaches to links, which can be seen throughout the page in responsitvity and organisation of buttons and links. There was another learning curve found within this module, that I am actually using this exercise as an opportunity to revise. Can you see any issues in particular with the navigation bar? I feel my eye for design has improved as well, althought I encourage you to be the judge of that and let me know if there are any glaring issues with how the website <em>feels.</em></p>

			<h3 id="community">Community</h3>
			<p>In one of the projects I did for Module 7 I was given an open-ended challenge with many possible solutions. I used the solution given as inspiration to try some different approaches and come up with my own ideas, however I ran into a small problem with the formatting of my objects. I shared my quandry with a forum of people taking a range of courses from Codecademy and lo and behold as I was typing this someone replied with a solution! They also gave some glowing feedback on the changes I had made to the example solution.</p>

			<p>Although the weather has deterred us from being in the garden as much, Katy's flowers are still blooming lovely. White petunias and roses are coming into their own and much work has been done to ensure balance is maintained. New Neigbour Thomas was also singing the praises of Katy's work, which I was more than happy to brag about on her behalf. I invited him to join in on the other side if he felt so inclined so we'll wait and see what happens there!</p>

			<p class="neilVoice">It's been a very busy week and I am so tired I'm having to dictate this to dada rather than typing for him as normal. On Monday I went to the vets and they told me I was perfect. On Tuesday I went to the groomers and they told me I was perfect. On Wednesday I had a day off to myself so I caught up with my admin. On Thursday I visited my best friends Harley and Ivy and they told me I was I perfect. On Friday dada made me walk all the way to Pollok park as well as my walk at Pollok park which was rude, dada is not perfect. (You better not do any editorialising!) I was so bamboozled when I went into my favourite river and there wasn't any fur between me and the water, I yelped so loudly <span class="dadaVoice">- The yelp was so loud I ran down to the riverside expecting carnage only for the cheeky scramble champ to have run up the other side, over the bridge and around behind me - </span>and it was so funny when dada thought I had fallen in. On Saturday I visited my nemesis Lola. I don't want to be her nemesis but she wants to be mine. She kept bonking me and running inside and barking "I'm the Queen of the castle and you're a dirty rascal". It was rude. There were lots of other people there too I guess. It was a lot of fun and I am very tired.</p>

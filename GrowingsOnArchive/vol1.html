		<p>This blog is a fun way I have thought up to keep you posted on all things Brooks Hughes, not just my coding improvements. If there's anything you would like to see feel free to let us know. It will hopefully also be a good indicator of the progress I make as the quality of these communiqu√©s improves!</p>

		<h2>Coding News</h2>
		<p>As you can probably already see, everything is a little bit basic just now. The main concern of the first chapter (of over 30!) is focused on the fundamental building blocks of a website. Here you should be able to see a title in the tab of the browser, links that take you to the relevant sections of the page, relevant images and a table of information. Hopefully before long I will be able to reliably include some more <em>aesthetic</em> choices that go beyond Times New Roman, <em>italics</em> and <strong>bold</strong>!</p>

		<h2>Tales From the Garden</h2>
		<p>Katy has been hard at work in the scorching heat this week bringing colour to The Wickets. A sad and drab row of gravel has been utterly transformed into a cornucopia of beauty and life. My words will fail to do it justice so have a look for yourself!</p>

		<p>In fact it has been so nice outside that this evening we made the most of it and had a lovely supper in the sunshine! Katy is as good a chef as a gardener (but we knew that already!)</p>

		<p>From the dog's mouth:<br>"<em>I had the best time ever at Loch Lomond this week, I ran around on the stoney beach and dipped my paws in the water. It's still too cold for me! Mama says that come September I might like it more because it shouldn't be as cold. I'm trying some new kibbles and tonight is my first one. So far, so tasty! Mama and Dada still haven't given me enough chicken. Oscilliating between cute and chaos until they give me a whole chicken. This was hard work dictating all this to Dada so I'm going to have a nap now, it's my best hobby.</em>"</p>

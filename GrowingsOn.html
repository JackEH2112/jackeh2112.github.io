		<h2>We're Moving House!</h2>
		<p class="subHeading">AAAAAAH!</p>
		<p>What a whirlwind. It's news so big its taking precedence in this voume of the newsletter! Coding and Pupdates can be found below but holy moly it's hard to think about them right now.</p>

				<h4>3 Years of Southside</h4>
				<p>Reflecting on the last 3 years
					<br><br>
					Just over 3 years ago, Katy bought a flat, I escaped Canadian Flavor Lockdown, and then we endured lockdown thinking of the potential of our first flat together. We eventually got in before almost immediately abandoning ship again til the next summer. In a way although it has felt homely, it has never really felt like <em>home</em>. Maybe because of that to-ing and fro-ing it has always felt disjointed here. It is a chapter with multiple threads that never seemed to come together until now as it comes to an end.
					<br><br>
					Of course there are plenty things that will keep us coming back to Glasgow, so it's less of a goodbye and more of a see you later.

				<h4>Greatest Hits</h4>
				<p>This is where we lived when we got married and when we got Neil. This is where we celebrated escaping Lockdown 1.0. This is where we laid a floor in the bedroom and didn't fall out after the shop calculated how much wood we needed incorrectly. This is where I built MegaDesk and Katy didn't leave me at B&Q with the wood that didn't fit in the car.</p>

				<h4>What We'll Miss</h4>
				<p>This has by far been the most community orientated neighbourhood I've lived in. It feels strange to say that I'm going to miss my neighbours! The McMillan Bar and Chop House being on the doorstep has been great, which has been a lovely reminder of the first time I met Katy's mum! The parks around us are also incredibly lovely.</p>

				<h4>What We're Looking Forward To</h4>
				<p>We're going to be a walk away from Stirling Castle. We're going to be closer to Fife and Perth. We're still going to be close enough to Glasgow. Gang, we're going to have A GARDEN. Grumpy James won't be yelling at us for having a dog.</p>
			</section>
			<section class="hhSBox b">
				<h4>The New Flat</h4>
				<p>There are so many things to be excited about in the flat. Numbers 1-7 are the garden. We're going to be able to open the door and Neil will have a level of freedom that might go to his head. There are so many gardening opportunities for Katy and the nook at the back looks like a tranquil spot that might rival monasteries.</p>

				<h4>X Years of Stirling</h4>
				<p>I'm examining a crystal ball and trying to see what Stirling might have in store for us. Who knows how long we'll be there? Katy of course has been on top of the house hunt for so long that school quality has been a factor in the decision making process. Serendipitously, when we were walking around Stirling after viewing the property we noticed a few coding businesses... And of course, Bannockburn being just down the road gives a lot of historical significance to the area. As already noted, Stirling is central to almost everywhere and we can commute in so many directions.<br><br>The flat has room to grow as much as we do. The sun room is surrounded by paving as opposed to garden... and the shed at the back of the garden may see an upgrade so Katy has somewhere to hide all my guitars and noise too!</p>

		<h2>Code Updates</h2>
		<p class="subHeading">Well, back to coding I guess...</p>
		<p>Have you noticed anything different besides the big news? To be fair that may have eclipsed the layout changes. Using grids has made arranging different blocks of the page so much easier. Overall, progress feels a bit slower this week but I had a struggle with an assignment that took me a while to solve. Hopefully now that the whirlwind of the last week is settling I can focus on coding more again! And the struggle assignment made it easier to get through the grid lessons so swings and roundabouts!</p>

				<h5>From the Dog's Mouth</h5>
				<p>Well, this is a nonsense. I have been dragged here all the way from Spain, I have not been given anywhere near enough chicken and now we're going somewhere else?! <br>Honestly...<br><br>I have noticed this last week that mama and dada have been fixing the hallway up and doing lots of tidying so I've been trying to intercept them because I don't want to leave. I will miss all my friends (Bilba, best friend Stephen upstairs, all the ducks at the park that I like to scare). I know all my walk routes so well I could do them myself even though mama and dada won't let me. I won't be able to bark at other people coming and going as easily because no one else is going to have our door? <br>It's very weird.</p>
